Hi everyone, We are facing an issue trying to get the Approver's Name and Approval Date to print on the very first automated PDF output right after a Purchase Order is approved via the Fiori My Inbox app. We understand that since it's the first print following approval, data won't be available in Workflow tables (i.e. I_WorkflowStatusOverview) yet, so using BAdI MM_PUR_S4_PO_MODIFY_HEADER would not take effect unless PO is changed.
