Hi everyone, I'm investigating a Kafka consumer behavior in SAP Integration Suite where the same message is sporadically processed by different BTP runtime instances. I was able to reproduce the behavior in our DEV tenant using a simple iFlow. Configuration / Default: Kafka Partitions: 1 Parallel Consumers: 1 Error Handling: Skip Failed Message Heartbeat Interval: 3 seconds Session Timeout: 10 seconds Request Timeout: 30 seconds Why did I add a 2-minute delay?
