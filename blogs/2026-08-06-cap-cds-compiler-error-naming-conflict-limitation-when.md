Hi SAP Community, I am building a CAP application and encountered a behavior with the CDS compiler regarding inline projection/flattening of associations that feels like a compiler limitation or edge-case bug. I have two entities in my schema (PurchaseOrders and GoodsReceipts). When trying to project their associations in a service definition using the simple as NewName shortcut, one works flawlessly while the other fails with a compilation error.
